How to use [Packages](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/)

I have some example Lovelace views in the lovelace-example folder.

SolaX Inverter versions:

[solax_x1_hybrid_g2_pylontech.yaml](https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-config/blob/master/packages/solax_x1_hybrid_g2_pylontech.yaml) is formatted for the Gen 2 with PylonTech Batteries, as the charge rate and some values off-sets are different to the newer Gen3 with SolaX Triple Power batteries.
[solax_x1_hybrid_g3_triplepower.yaml](https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-config/blob/master/packages/solax_x1_hybrid_g3_triplepower.yaml) is formatted for the Gen 3 with SolaX Triple Power Batteries.
[solax_x3_hybrid_g3_triplepower.yaml](https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-config/blob/master/packages/solax_x3_hybrid_g3_triplepower.yaml) is formatted for the 3-Phase Gen 3 with SolaX Triple Power Batteries also include the full known list of registers, possible not all registers will return values..
